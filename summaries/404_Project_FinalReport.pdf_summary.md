The document presents a comprehensive assessment of Lateral Thinking Problem Tasks led by Daniel Chen, William Pfauth, Sean Leonard, and Harshini Sadineni, focusing on two main puzzles: the Sentence Puzzle and the Word Puzzle. It explores the challenges faced by advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models in lateral reasoning tasks, which demand creative problem-solving and abstract thought processes, contrasting them with traditional vertical (logical) reasoning. The authors utilize the BRAINTEASER dataset—a compilation of various sentence and word puzzles—to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of different models, specifically logistic regression and recurrent neural networks (RNN).

The project's innovative methodology involves developing a model from scratch, unlike previous studies that used pre-trained language models (PLMs) or additional evidence retrieval. The evaluation criteria include preprocessing techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and later enhancements with BERT vectorization, along with performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for both the Word Puzzle (WP) and Sentence Puzzle (SP) datasets. 

Results indicate that the Logistic Regression model, while simpler, achieved notable performance metrics on both datasets, outperforming the LSTM model in accuracy but showing limitations in capturing complex patterns. The LSTM model, advanced through architecture modifications and additional layers, demonstrated potential in identifying subtle relationships but initially lagged in accuracy and recall. Notably, the SP-trained model emerged as the most effective, reflecting improvements after revising evaluation methods.

The document suggests further refinements including hyperparameter tuning for the LSTM model, exploring alternative machine learning approaches like Random Forests and Transformers, and enhancing dataset robustness through synthetic example generation. It advocates for developing an evaluation dataset with increasing complexity to better diagnose model performance, as well as incorporating interpretability measures to understand decision-making processes.

Moreover, the findings underscore restrictions in the current SemEval BRAINTEASER benchmark’s dataset size, which limits the scope for model training and generalization. Future research should focus on expanding this dataset and leveraging multimodal approaches, as well as strategies for visual and logical reasoning, to further advance AI systems’ capabilities in lateral thinking. Overall, while traditional models like Logistic Regression perform adequately on straightforward tasks, the LSTM models, particularly when enhanced with BERT, show promise for more complex reasoning tasks, demonstrating significant progress in the field of AI and logic understanding.
